This is a lightly modified version of STC ("simple tetris clone") v0.3 from
http://code.google.com/p/simple-tetris-clone/ and available under the MIT
license: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

Its only dependency is libSDL.

To build, set your CROSS_COMPILE environment variable (ex: "arm-linux-") and
ROOTFS_PATH variable (which should point to the rootfs directory tree where
your libSDL headers can be found), then type "make".

To "install", copy ./sdl-stc to /usr/bin on your device and copy the .bmp files
in ./bin/sdl to /usr/share on your device.

The changes are:
- adjust for 320x240 screen (and therefore make the grid less tall)
- move the "next piece" up a bit
- change the default controls to match the buttons that we have
- change some file paths around

The "statistics" graphics don't really fit in a 320x240 screen but they're left
alone, they simply won't render.

Controls:
- arrows move the piece around, the up arrow rotates it clockwise
- A toggles whether the next piece is shown
- right shoulder toggles whether the "ghost piece" is shown
- left shoulder restarts the game
- the pause button toggles the pause state
- the home button exits the game
